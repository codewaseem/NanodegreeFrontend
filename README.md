# NanodegreeFrontend

I thank Udacity for providing me with the opportunity to pursue their Front-End Web Developers Nanodegree Program. I applied for the Grow with Google Developer's scholarship and got it.
For six months, starting from April 24, 2018, I will be sharing my work on exercises with my mentor through github as advised.
So, all the files you see here are just from the assignments that I get on the course.
